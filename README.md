## ðŸ“Œ Architecture 

The application initializes dependencies and runs the main widget tree with Bloc state management:

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Template?

- âœ… Scalability â€“ Modular structure allows easy expansion.
- âœ… Testability â€“ Well-defined layers improve testing coverage.
- âœ… Maintainability â€“ Clear separation of concerns simplifies updates.
- âœ… Reusability â€“ Shared components reduce redundant code.
This template is an ideal starting point for professional Flutter projects, enabling developers to build robust, high-performance applications. ðŸš€

The architecture is inspired by **Clean Architecture** principles, ensuring a structured flow between data, business logic, and UI components. The project is divided into distinct layers:  

- **Common Layer**: Shared utilities, routing, configurations, constants, and helper functions.  
- **Feature Layer**: Manages individual application features, including data handling and presentation.  
- **Core Layer**: Contains essential services, network management, and reusable components.

### **App (`app/`)**  
Handles application logic, state management, and UI rendering.  

- **common/** â€“ Shared utilities and helpers.  
  - `cache_manager/` â€“ Manages local caching.  
  - `config/` â€“ Holds configuration settings.  
  - `constants/` â€“ Defines global constants.  
  - `functions/` â€“ Utility functions for common operations.  
  - `get_it/` â€“ Handles dependency injection.  
  - `router/` â€“ Manages navigation and route control.  
  - `widgets/` â€“ Contains globally reusable UI components.  
- **features/** â€“ Organizes the application's functionalities.  
  - `data/` â€“ Handles all data-related operations.  
    - `datasources/` â€“ Manages API calls and local storage.  
    - `models/` â€“ Data models (DTOs).  
    - `repositories/` â€“ Handles data fetching and caching logic.  
  - `presentation/` â€“ Manages UI components and state.  
    - `test/` â€“ Includes view, widget and state management.  
      - `cubit/` â€“ state management logic.  
      - `view/` â€“ UI screens.  
      - `widgets/` â€“ reusable widgets.


### **Core (`core/`)**  
Contains low-level utilities, services, and application-wide configurations.  

- **assets/** â€“ AssetsHelper.  
- **dio_manager/** â€“ Manages API requests and responses.  
- **either/** â€“ Utility for handling success/error cases.  
- **extensions/** â€“ Custom Dart extensions for improving functionality.  
- **helpers/** â€“ Collection of helper functions and classes.  
- **keys/** â€“ Stores key identifiers such as API keys.  
- **logger/** â€“ Implements logging for debugging and monitoring.  
- **network_control/** â€“ Manages network connectivity states.  
- **result/** â€“ Handles operation results (success, failure).  
- **scripts/** â€“ Automates development workflows.  
- **widgets/** â€“ Globally shared UI components.
